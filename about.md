<p>I am a Economics PhD student at Brown University. I am getting a masters in Computer Science through Brown's <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/gradschool/opengraduateeducation">Open Graduate Education fellowship</a>. I did my undergrad at Williams College and majored in Economics and Computer Science. </p>

<p>I am interested in monetary economics, macroeconomics, and machine learning. I want to build models with richer production and household heterogeneity. I also want to leverage machine learning techniques and alternative data to answer important macroeconomic questions.</p>
