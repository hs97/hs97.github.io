<p>I am an incoming Economics PhD student at Brown University. I did my undergrad at Williams College and majored in Economics and Computer Science. </p>

<p>I am passionate about finding elegant solutions to explain real-life economic phenomena and craft smart policy responses. Through my research in economics, mathematics and computer science, I have acquired technical knowledge in machine learning and independent research skills. I will combine my technical skills and research ability to answer key macroeconomics questions, focusing especially on developing countries.</p>
