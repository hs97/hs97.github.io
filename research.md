<p><b><i>Abstract:</i></b> Ethical certification labels are increasingly popular as people become more conscious of global trade inequality. However, verifying the truthfulness of these certification labels is difficult in a deep global supply chain, and false certification exists. I propose a two-seller, one-buyer duopoly signaling game to study how prosocial preferences and information barriers contribute to false certification in the market for ethically sourced and labelled products. My results show that buyer-side prosocial preferences, such as warm glow and altruism, make room for false certification. When the buyer is driven by warm glow, false certification occurs regardless of information availability. When the buyer has no information on the sellerâ€™s prosocial type, sellers who certify truthfully are at a competitive disadvantage and the market is flooded with falsely certified products. Also, when buyers are more likely to believe in products that exhibit high certification effort, such as fancier packaging and more elaborate websites, sellers try to out-certify each other in order to out-compete each other, and certification becomes even more costly.</p></li>
